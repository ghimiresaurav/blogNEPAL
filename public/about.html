      The best ideas can change who we are. BlogNepal is where those ideas take
      shape, take off, and spark powerful conversations. We’re an open platform
      where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.
      Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of any
      topic and bring new ideas to the surface. Our purpose is to spread these

      We’re creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports
      nuance, complexity, and vital storytelling without giving in to the
      incentives of advertising. It’s an environment that’s open to everyone but
      promotes substance and authenticity. And it’s where deeper connections
      forged between readers and writers can lead to discovery and growth.
      Together with millions of collaborators, we’re building a trusted and
      vibrant ecosystem fueled by important ideas and the people who think about
      them.
